### Yuppy City Simulator

This project will provide a service that asks a user questions about their preferred city features and the weight of these features, and returns a score for each major city. The highest score will determine the best fit.

#### Program Features
* City metrics. Our project will offer metrics that simply break down desirable features based on major studies.
* A database that will house all the city data.
* Algorithm to generate scores based on weighting and data.
* User UI to input data and display scores.
